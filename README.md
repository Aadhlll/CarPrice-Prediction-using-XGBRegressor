# CarPrice-Prediction-using-XGBRegressor
Our project employs XGBRegressor, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to accurately forecast car prices based on key attributes such as make, model, mileage, and year. We compared various regression models and found XGBRegressor to deliver the highest accuracy.

#Features:
Utilizes a dataset containing information about various cars including their make, model, mileage, year, and price.
Implements feature engineering techniques to preprocess and clean the data for modeling.
Compares the performance of multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and XGBoost Regression.
Selects XGBRegressor as the model of choice based on its superior accuracy.

#Technologies Used:
Python
Seaborn
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
XGBoost

#Project Structure:

##Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Acquire data from a reliable source or dataset repository.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

##Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train each regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared.
Select the XGBRegressor model based on its highest accuracy.

##Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the XGBRegressor model using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize performance.

##Prediction and Deployment:
Deploy the trained XGBRegressor model for making price predictions on new car data.
Create an intuitive interface for users to input car features and get predicted prices.
Optionally, deploy the project as a web application or API for wider accessibility.

#Usage:
